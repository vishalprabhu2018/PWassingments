1)What is padding and margin and when do you use them?
Padding and margin are CSS properties used for layout and spacing of elements on a webpage.
Margin refers to the space outside an element's border, while padding refers to the space inside an element's border. 
You can use margin to create spacing between elements or to push an element away from the edge of the screen or another element. 
Padding is often used to create space between an element's content and its border.
Here are some common use cases for margin and padding:

Use margin to create space between elements on a page, such as between sections or paragraphs of text.
Use padding to create space around an element's content, such as within a button or a box.
Use negative margin to overlap elements or pull them closer together.
Use padding to ensure that text or other content does not touch an element's border or edge.
Overall, margin and padding are useful for creating white space and visual separation between elements on a webpage. 
They are essential tools for web designers and developers to create visually appealing and functional layouts.

3)Explain min-height, min-width, max-height and max width in CSS?
The display property in CSS is used to specify how an HTML element should be displayed on the webpage. The three most common values for the display
property are:

inline - This displays an element as an inline element, meaning that it will flow with the surrounding text and other inline elements. 
Examples of inline elements include links (<a>), images (<img>), and spans (<span>).

block - This displays an element as a block-level element, meaning that it will take up the full width of its parent container and create a new line before
and after it. Examples of block-level elements include paragraphs (<p>), headings (<h1>-<h6>), and divs (<div>).

inline-block - This displays an element as an inline-level element that can also have a width, height, padding, and margin. This is useful when you 
want an element to be positioned inline with other elements, but also have some block-level properties. Examples of inline-block elements include 
buttons (<button>), form inputs (<input>), and images (<img>).

Other values for the display property include none, which hides an element from the webpage, and flex, which creates a flexible container for laying out 
elements in rows or columns.

By using the display property, you can control the layout and behavior of HTML elements on your webpage, allowing you to create 
visually appealing and functional designs.
