1) Why do we start learning a programming language with “Hello World!"?
  Hello World is used by the beginners when they start to code. So hello world program basically print string hello world in the screen.
  That is basically used to test by the new programmer when they first start to learn the code.

2) How is th use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?
   Comments are basically used by the programmer or developer so that other people can understand the code or when the coder sees that code after
some time they can understand that what code  they had written in the past . So comment are basically text which are written in the code which is not compiled or
interpreted by the machine. 
In html we write comment in this way for eg <!-- this is comment tag in html -->

Syntax: <!-- content -->

3) What are elements tags and attributes and the diffrent between them.
Elements are the building blocks of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) that define the structure and content of a web page. For example,
the paragraph element is written as <p>, and its content goes between the opening <p> and closing </p> tags.
Attributes are used to provide additional information or modify the default behavior of an HTML element. 
They are added to the opening tag of an element, in the form of key-value pairs. For example, the "src" attribute in an <img> element specifies the source URL of an image.
So, in short, elements define the structure and content of a web page, while attributes provide additional information or modify the default behavior of elements.

4) Briefly explain what HTML entities are.
HTML entities are special characters or symbols that are reserved in HTML and have a specific meaning or function. 
These entities are represented by a string of characters that start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).
For example, the less than symbol (<) is represented by the HTML entity <, and the greater than symbol (>) is represented by the HTML entity >. 
HTML entities are used to display special characters or symbols in a web page that might otherwise be interpreted as HTML code.
Some commonly used HTML entities include © for copyright symbol, — for a long dash, and £ for the British pound symbol. 
By using HTML entities, you can ensure that your web content is displayed correctly, regardless of the user's device or browser.
