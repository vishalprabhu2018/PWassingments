1)What are inline and block elemens in HTML and the difference between them? Name a few inline elements and block elements
In HTML, elements are classified as either inline elements or block elements based on their default display behavior.

Block elements occupy the full width of their parent container and create a new block formatting context, 
causing any following elements to be positioned below it. Examples of block elements include:

<div>
<p>
<h1> to <h6>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>
<header>
<footer>
<section>
Inline elements, on the other hand, only occupy the width of their content and do not create a new block formatting context. 
Examples of inline elements include:

<span>
<a>
<img>
<button>
<input>
<label>
<select>
<textarea>
You can change the default display behavior of an element by using CSS. For example, you can set a block element to display as an inline element 
or vice versa.


2)How to work with images in HTML and explain in detail </img> tag important attribute.

The <img> tag is used to embed images in HTML. The tag has several important attributes that are commonly used to define the properties of an image:
src: The source of the image file, specified as a URL. This attribute is required for the <img> tag to work.
alt: The alternative text for the image, which is used by screen readers and displayed when the image cannot be loaded. The alt attribute should describe 
the content of the image and is important for accessibility.
width and height: The width and height of the image in pixels. These attributes are optional, but they can be used to specify the size of the image if it 
needs to be different from the actual size of the image file.
title: The title text for the image, which is displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
style: The inline CSS styles for the image. This attribute can be used to apply CSS styles to the image directly, without the need for a separate CSS file.
Example:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A picture of a cat" width="300" height="200" title="A cute cat" style="border: 1px solid black;">
It's worth noting that the </img> tag doesn't exist in HTML. 
The <img> tag is self-closing, meaning that it doesn't have a closing tag, and should be written as <img /> in XHTML or <img> in HTML5.


3)How to interlink web pages and navigate people to other websites?
The <a> (anchor) tag is used to create links in HTML, allowing users to navigate between pages and to other websites. The href attribute is used to specify
the URL of the linked resource, and the text between the opening and closing <a> tags serves as the anchor text that is displayed to the user.

Example:

php
Copy code
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit the Example website</a>
In this example, the anchor text "Visit the Example website" is linked to the URL "https://www.example.com". When the user clicks the link, they will be 
taken to the specified URL in their web browser.

You can also create links to other pages within your own website by using relative URLs. For example:

php
Copy code
<a href="about.html">Learn more about us</a>
In this example, the link points to the "about.html" page within the same website.

It's important to use meaningful and descriptive anchor text for links, as this helps users understand the context and destination of the link, 
and it also improves the accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) of your website.
