1.What are the new things introduced in HTML 5?
Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced several new semantic elements such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <article>. These elements make it easier to create 
well-structured, meaningful web pages that are easier to read and understand.
Audio and Video: HTML5 introduced new <audio> and <video> elements that make it easy to embed audio and video content directly into web pages without 
the need for third-party plugins like Flash.
Canvas: HTML5 introduced the <canvas> element, which provides a way to create dynamic, interactive graphics and animations using JavaScript.
Local Storage: HTML5 introduced new local storage features that allow web pages to store data locally on the user's computer, making it possible to create 
web applications that can work offline.
Geolocation: HTML5 introduced a new geolocation feature that allows web pages to access the user's location, making it possible to create location-based 
services.
Web Workers: HTML5 introduced the concept of web workers, which allow web pages to run scripts in the background, freeing up the main thread for other tasks.
Drag and Drop: HTML5 introduced new drag and drop features that make it easier to create interactive web applications that allow users to drag and drop items
on the screen.
Form Controls: HTML5 introduced several new form controls such as <input type="date">, <input type="time">, and <input type="range">, which make it easier to 
create forms that are more user-friendly and interactive.

2.What are semantic tags? Give a couple of examples.
Semantic tags are HTML tags that describe the content they contain, rather than just indicating how the content should be displayed. Semantic tags are 
designed to provide a clearer, more meaningful structure to web pages, making them easier to read and understand for both human readers and search engines. 
Here are some examples of semantic tags:

<header>: The <header> tag is used to define a header section for a web page or a section of a web page. The header typically includes the title or 
logo of the page, as well as other introductory content.

<nav>: The <nav> tag is used to define a section of a web page that contains navigation links. The navigation links typically allow users to move between 
different pages or sections of the website.
<article>: The <article> tag is used to define a self-contained section of content within a web page. The article typically contains a complete, standalone 
piece of content, such as a blog post, news article, or product review.

<section>: The <section> tag is used to define a generic section of a web page. The section may contain related content, 
such as a group of blog posts or a set of products on an e-commerce site.

<footer>: The <footer> tag is used to define a footer section for a web page or a section of a web page. 
The footer typically includes copyright information, contact details, and other related content.

By using semantic tags, web developers can create more structured, meaningful web pages that are easier to read and understand. This can improve the user 
experience, make it easier for search engines to index and rank the content, and help ensure that the website is accessible to users with disabilities.



3.List some uses of semantic tags.

Semantic tags are HTML tags that provide a meaningful structure to the content on a web page. Here are some common uses of semantic tags:

Improving Accessibility: Semantic tags can help make a website more accessible to users with disabilities, such as visual impairments. For example, 
screen readers rely on semantic markup to identify the purpose and structure of the content on a web page.

Enhancing SEO: Semantic tags can help improve a website's search engine optimization (SEO) by making it easier for search engines to understand the 
content of the page. This can improve the page's ranking in search engine results.

Organizing Content: Semantic tags can help to organize the content on a web page into logical sections, making it easier for users to read and navigate. 
For example, the <header> tag can be used to identify the top of the page, the <nav> tag can be used to indicate the navigation menu, and the <footer> 
tag can be used to identify the bottom of the page.

Creating Structured Data: Semantic tags can be used to create structured data that can be easily understood by other web applications. For example, 
the <article> tag can be used to identify a blog post, while the <product> tag can be used to identify a product listing.

Supporting Responsive Design: Semantic tags can be used to create a more flexible and responsive design for a website, making it easier to adapt to 
different screen sizes and device types.

Overall, semantic tags can be used to provide a clearer, more meaningful structure to the content on a web page, making it easier to read and understand
for both users and machines.
