2.Explain all media elements and how they work.
The media element is used to display and play media files such as images, videos and audio. They are as follow.
<img> element: Used to display images on a web page. The <img> element is a self-closing tag and includes the src attribute to specify the location of the 
image file. Other attributes such as alt, width, and height can also be used to provide additional information about the image.
<video> element: Used to embed videos on a web page. The <video> element includes a source tag (<source>) to specify the location of the video file, 
as well as attributes such as width, height, and controls to customize the appearance and behavior of the video player.
<audio> element: Used to embed audio files on a web page. The <audio> element is similar to the <video> element, and includes a source tag to specify 
the location of the audio file, as well as attributes such as controls and loop to customize the behavior of the audio player.
<source> element: Used to specify the location of media files for use with the <video> and <audio> elements. Multiple <source> elements can be used to 
provide different file formats or resolutions for the same media file, allowing the browser to choose the best option based on the device and connection.

3.What is get and post in form?
In HTML, the GET and POST methods are used to submit form data to a server. Both methods are used to send data to the server, but they work in slightly
different ways.When a form is submitted using the GET method, the data is appended to the URL in the form of a query string. This means that the data is 
visible in the URL, and can be bookmarked or shared with others. The GET method is typically used for forms that retrieve data, such as a search form, and 
is not recommended for forms that submit sensitive data such as passwords.
In contrast, when a form is submitted using the POST method, the data is sent in the body of the HTTP request, rather than in the URL. This means that the 
data is not visible in the URL, and is generally considered to be more secure than the GET method. The POST method is typically used for forms that submit 
data to the server, such as a login form or a contact form.



4. List all the input types we have in forms?
<input type="text">: A simple text input field for the user to enter a single line of text.
<input type="password">: A text input field that obscures the characters entered, typically used for passwords.
<input type="email">: A text input field for the user to enter an email address. The browser will perform basic validation to ensure that the input 
looks like an email address.
<input type="number">: A text input field that allows the user to enter a number.
<input type="checkbox">: A checkbox that the user can select or deselect.
<input type="radio">: A set of radio buttons that allow the user to select one option from a group of options.
<input type="date">: A text input field that allows the user to enter a date.
<input type="file">: A file upload field that allows the user to select a file from their computer.
<input type="submit">: A button that the user can click to submit the form.
